## üß† Overview
`ux_job_scraper` is a lightweight automation tool that gathers UX-related job postings from public job boards and APIs, normalizes the data, and exports it to clean CSV or dashboard-ready formats.

It was originally built to demonstrate **Python scripting, API consumption, and data-pipeline design** in a real-world use case: managing job searches efficiently.
